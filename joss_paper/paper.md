# Summary
Two_stage_SP package optimizes sizing of energy components for a district energy system. This package considers five selected energy components: natural gas boilers, combined heating and power, solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, and batteries. These five energy components and the grid can provide heating, cooling, and electricity needs of a group of buildings. Uncertainties in energy demand, solar irradiance, wind speed, and electricity emissions are considered in this package. A user can change the case study's location, modify the energy components' charectristics, and energy configuration.
