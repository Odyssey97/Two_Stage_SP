# Two-Stage-Stochastic-Programming
This repository provides a framework to perform two-stage stochastic programming on a district energy system considering uncertainties in energy demands, solar irradiance, wind speed, and electricity emission factors.

To run the two-stage stochastic optimization, you should use the main_twostage_SP.py file. The input data should be entered using the EditableFile.csv.
